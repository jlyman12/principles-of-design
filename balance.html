     <h1>Balance</h1>
     <p>"In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious" (p.51).</p>
       <p>When designing a layout, you don't want everything clustered in one area of the page. Your design has to have balance between positive and negative space and has to be centered. If you have too much going on in one area and not enough in another, your design will look off balance.</p>
       <h2>iPhone Picture</h2>

     <img src="balance.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Propeller plane"/>
     <figcaption>This is a small plane with balanced wings.
     </figcaption>
   </figure>
       <p>Balance is key to life and design. Poor balance can hurt you physically, but you also have to have balance in your layouts. Text and images have to balance and not make the page look like it is lopsided or cluttered. The plane above also has to have balance. Too much weight on one side could cause the plane to crash. The same thing can happen in design. </p>

           <figcaption>This bridge has to be balanced to allow people to cross safely, just like designs.
