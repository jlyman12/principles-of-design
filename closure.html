     <h1>Closure</h1>
     <p>"We mentally fill in the gaps in order to complete a perceived shape. In this example, we see a star shape even though there is no star outlined. The idea of designing with only a part but having your viewer perceive the whole opens up interesting compositional opportunities, including the interplay of positive and negative space" (p.78). </p>
     <p>Sometimes, it isn't positive space that creates the design, it's the negative space. When a design of positive space can create a shape of white space on the page, the mind will close that shape in and see it as another design. This is another example of how White Space is Not Your Enemy.</p>

     <figcaption>The roof of the stadium has windows that open up creating closure based on the design around it.

       <p>Closure is one of the harder principles to find in the real world, but it can be one of the more ornate designs you can use in architecture or other arts. In the picture above, the windows create a design based on the items around the opening. Other times, you can see a cross cut out of a wall in a church and even though there is no cross, the opening makes the viewer see the shape that is missing.</p>
