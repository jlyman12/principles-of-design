     <h1>Movement</h1>
       <p>"The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eyeâ€™s flow through the composition. The flow of lines can move the eye across the page or screen. Lines, then, can create movement, and different kinds of linear movement tend to communicate different kinds of symbolic messages" (p.52). </p>
       <p>Viewers want to know where to look when looking at a graphic. After seeing the focal point, your design should funnel the eyes towards the next thing you want them to see. That is where movement comes in. The use of lines can lead readers through the page and create an aesthetically pleasing design as well.</p>
    <figure>
     <img src="movement.jpg" class="responsive" alt="Corn hole board"/>
     <figcaption>The corn hole board has lines leading the eyes, or the bag, to the hole.

   </figure>
       <p>Our eyes don't always know where to go. Movement is important and is often executed using lines leading our eyes to where we need to go. In the image, the white lines lead you to the focal point of the design, the hole. If the lines pointed somewhere else, your eyes may not know where to throw the bag. Lines in design are crucial to getting the viewers to see what they need to.</p>
