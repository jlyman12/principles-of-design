     <h1>Continuity</h1>
     <p>"Our minds will continue a pattern beyond its ending points. Further, our eyes will follow the direction of a line. On the left, our minds see a single cross shape instead of four shorter converging lines. On the right, our eyes follow the direction of the Aâ€™s swoop and continue on to the star. Applying this concept can add a sense of direction and movement to your layout. Ergo, flow" (p.76).</p>
    <p>We aren't trained to dissect parts of a design and notice where a certain line ends and where another shape begins. We will always try to put the different aspects of the design together to create the overarching product the designer wants us to see. There can be continuity in the design because our eyes will continue past the end of a certain part and see it as part of the whole. </p>

       <p>Continuity is one of the more commonly used theories in design. Our minds often put shapes together that are completely separate, but the designer knows how it will look. In the image, the scoreboard combines many different screens, but because it looks like one large loop, our minds have put it together as a "Halo Scoreboard"</p>
