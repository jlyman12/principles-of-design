     <h1>Proximity</h1>
     <p>"We perceive objects that are close together as belonging to the same group. A related law, the law of Common Fate, says that we perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group. On the left, we interpret one group of circles. On the right, we interpret two groups of circles. The ability to group content aids in creating organization and order in layouts" (p.76).</p>
     <p>Even if objects are not similar, if they are grouped together in a design, the reader's mind will perceive them as part of a group. The same goes for separation. If there is negative space between groups of objects, you assume that they are not meant to be together.</p>

     <figcaption>The door of the fridge contains many items, but the eyes will group them together based on where they are placed.

       <p>Proximity is seen in design, but it is also seen in the real world. Based on where you are in the world and who you are around, people will be seen as a certain group. In the picture above, the drinks are grouped together while condiments are placed in another area. Depending on the space between different items, the grouping of them will be perceived as different. The same can be said in design.</p>
