     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p> "Unity, may seem a little abstract compared to the other principles. Unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together. You wouldn’t wear cargo shorts and flip-flops with a tuxedo shirt, jacket and tie. There’s no unity between the informality of cargos and the formality of tuxedos, and wearing the two together makes for a visually disjointed confusing outfit. Th e same principle applies in graphic design"(p.55).</p>
     <p>In design, everything has to look like it should go together. You wouldn't put six different fonts together on one page. You wouldn't put a picture of a boat on a page where you're talking about computer programs. The parts of your design should all work together to create the best final product.</p>

       <p>Unity is one of the more important principles of design. If parts of your design don't go together, it won't be aesthetically pleasing and it will be confusing to viewers. The cards in the picture all have the same logo and text on them. If half of them were Virginia Tech cards and half showed farm animals, the cards wouldn't look as good. This principle may seem simple, but it is crucial to creating a good design.</p>
