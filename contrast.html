     <h1>Contrast</h1>
     <p>"Contrast is an important principle for designing interesting (in contrast to dull) layouts. Contrast, as a principle, offers a great deal of flexibility. There are limitless ways to achieve it. Start with the elements of design. You can employ contrast between filled and empty space. You can employ contrasting sorts of lines or shapes. You may juxtapose contrasting sizes of objects. Introducing a pattern in proximity to no pattern results in contrast. Ditto for texture. Or you may contrast two different kinds of patterns or two different kinds of textures. Color and value also offer powerful contrast tools. Using both dark and light values or colors results in contrast" (p.51).</p>
       <p>Contrast can be used in many different ways. The most common thought when thinking of contrast is light and dark. If you put black text on a black background, you won't be able to see anything. You need contrast in order to make your design work. You need contrast between positive and negative space, and you need contrast between the graphics you are putting into your design.</p>

       <p>Contrast is a simple aspect of design, but crucial. Even though you want unity and everything in your design must match, contrasting shapes, colors, and lines can create the best layouts. This can also be seen throughout the real world. In the image, the fog close to the ground, contrasts with the clear skies above. Looking at only half the picture, you could completely mistake the weather outside. This contrast is what can make designs look the best.</p>
